This repository is the home for the `replit` Python package, which provides:

- A fully-featured database client for [Replit DB](https://docs.replit.com/category/databases).
- Tools and utilities for Flask Web Development, including an interface to Replit's User Authetication service
- Replit user profile metadata retrieval (more coming here!).
- A simple audio library that can play tones and audio files!

### Open Source License

### Setup

With poetry already setup, you can set up the repl for development with:

```
poetry install
```

### Continuous Integration

Running the database unittests `tests/test_database.py` depends on the repl https://replit.com/@util/database-test-jwt. You'll have access to this repl if you are a Replit employee. There's a secret
contained in that repl which you'll have to set as an environment variable in order to run the unittests.
Once you've done that, run the tests with:

```
poetry run python -m unittest
```
