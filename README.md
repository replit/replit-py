### `>>> import replit`

![compute](https://github.com/kennethreitz42/replit-py/blob/kr-cleanup/ext/readme.gif?raw=true)

This repository is the home for the `replit` Python package, which provides:

- A fully-featured database client for [Replit DB](https://docs.repl.it/misc/database).
- A Flask–based application framework for accellerating development on the platform.
- Replit user profile metadata retreival (more coming here!).

& other helpful toys and utilities, like...

- A simple audio library that can play tones and audio files!
- Some helpful functions for displaying ANSI colors within interactive terminal sessions.


### It's worth noting…


The [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) Python environment does not require any platform-specific code, however, these optional utilities provide additional platform features in a simple and accessible way.


*Example*: [Repl.it DB](https://docs.repl.it/misc/database) is an HTTP service, but an optional Python client (here!) is available.
